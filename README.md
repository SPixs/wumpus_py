# Hunt the Wumpus üê∫üï≥Ô∏è‚ú®

Welcome to **Hunt the Wumpus**, a classic text-based adventure game! üè∞

A 1:1 Python port of the original BASIC game from 1973.

The goal of this project is to be as similar as possible to the original source code.

## Welcome

**WELCOME TO 'HUNT THE WUMPUS'**

The Wumpus lives in a cave of **20 rooms**. Each room has **3 tunnels** leading to other rooms. (Look at a dodecahedron to see how this works‚Äîif you don't know what a dodecahedron is, ask someone.)

### Dodecahedron Illustration

To better understand the cave layout, refer to the illustrations below:

## Rules

### Hazards

#### Bottomless Pits

- **BOTTOMLESS PITS** - Two rooms have bottomless pits in them.
  - *If you go there, you fall into the pit (& lose!)*

#### Super Bats

- **SUPER BATS** - Two other rooms have super bats.
  - *If you go there, a bat grabs you and takes you to some other room at random. (Which might be troublesome)*

### Wumpus

The Wumpus is not bothered by the hazards (he has sucker feet and is too big for a bat to lift). Usually, he is asleep. Two things wake him up: **your entering his room** or **your shooting an arrow**.

- *If the Wumpus wakes, he moves (**P=.75**) one room or stays still (**P=.25**). After that, if he is where you are, he eats you up (& you lose!)*

### You

Each turn you may **move** or **shoot a crooked arrow**.

#### Moving

- **MOVING**: You can go one room (through one tunnel)

#### Arrows

- **ARROWS**: You have **5 arrows**. You lose when you run out.
- Each arrow can go from **1 to 5 rooms**. You aim by telling the computer the room numbers you want the arrow to go to.
- If the arrow can't go that way (i.e., no tunnel) it moves **at random** to the next room.
- *IF THE ARROW HITS THE WUMPUS, YOU WIN.*
- *IF THE ARROW HITS YOU, YOU LOSE.*

## Warnings

When you are **one room away** from the Wumpus or a hazard, the computer says:

- **WUMPUS**: `'I SMELL A WUMPUS'`
- **BAT**: `'BATS NEARBY'`
- **PIT**: `'I FEEL A DRAFT'`

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**
   - You are prompted to read the instructions. Choose **Y** to read or **N** to skip.
2. **Initialize the Cave**
   - The cave is set up with the player, Wumpus, pits, and bats in random rooms, ensuring no overlaps.
3. **Gameplay Loop**
   - **Display Location & Warnings**
     - Current room and tunnel connections are displayed.
     - Any nearby hazards are announced.
   - **Choose Action**
     - Decide to **SHOOT** an arrow or **MOVE** to another room.
4. **Shooting an Arrow**
   - Specify the number of rooms (**1-5**) the arrow will pass through.
   - Enter the sequence of room numbers for the arrow's path.
   - The arrow follows the path, checking for collisions with the Wumpus or the player.
   - If the arrow misses, the Wumpus may move.
5. **Moving to a Room**
   - Enter the room number you wish to move to.
   - If the move is valid, update your location and check for hazards.
6. **End Conditions**
   - **Win**: Shoot the Wumpus with an arrow.
   - **Lose**: Run out of arrows, fall into a pit, be eaten by the Wumpus, or hit by your own arrow.
7. **Replay Option**
   - After a game ends, choose whether to use the same cave setup or generate a new one.
